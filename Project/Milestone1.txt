Final Project, Milestone 1

Question: Planning to predict future price fluctuations based on historical pricing data available from the USDA

Data: USDA data for all produce products broken down by terminal market country wide going back one calendar year
https://www.marketnews.usda.gov/mnp/fv-home

Possible Issue: The data is pretty standardized without many missing values but it is a lot of data. 

Background: I work for a team of produce buyers who use this data everyday and I would like to make them a more useful tool.
